angular-30min
=============

A demo I used to introduce Angular in 30 minutes:

* client/index-step0.html : blank starter kit
* client/index-step1.html : ng-init, ng-model, ng-repeat, filter
* client/index-step2.html : controller
* client/index-step3.html : master details, routes, ng-animate
* client/index-step4.html : custom directives

Prepare live coding:

* node server.js in /server dir
* grunt server in /client dir
